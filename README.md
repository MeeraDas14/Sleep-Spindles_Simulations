# Sleep-Spindle Simulations
This repository contains the notebooks and scripts for simulating sleep spindles. It has separate simulations for isolated thalamocortical (TC) neurons, isolated thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) neurons, and connected TC-TRN circuits. The simulations are based on Hodgkin-Huxley equations. Thus, gating variables are defined in `gating_variables.py`. `init_regimes.py` has initialization functions, for example setting different values for conductances.   
Each notebook is organized into sections that address a scientific question, such as the role of an intrinsic current in burst generation in TC neuron and so on. 
Some  results were also presented at Bernstein Conference, Berlin, 2022. Cellular and network-level mechanisms underlying the initiation and heterogeneity of thalamic spindles. doi: 10.12751/nncn.bc2022.171
